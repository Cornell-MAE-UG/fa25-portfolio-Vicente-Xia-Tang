## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am currently a sophomore studying Biomedical Engineering in Cornell University. I was born in Venezuela but moved to the United States in 2012. I lived in Brooklyn, NY most of my life and attended Stuyvesant High School. I love researching about drug delivery systems and creating startups and scaling them to generate 7 figures in revenue annually. I love to play basketball and practice martial arts in my free time.
